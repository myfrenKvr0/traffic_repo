# A serverless customer repository web application and API built with Cloud Functions

The application is a traffic department repository website where users can post data entries containing data on road users. 
This application demonstrates how to build a serverless web application where static content is hosted in a storage bucket (here it uses GitHub Pages) 
and the backend is implemented with Cloud Functions. API Gateway is used to expose the Cloud Functions for the web user interface.
